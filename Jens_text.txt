We created a CLI on the client Computer. The Client runs an apache server as well 
as an mysql server. The client uses the Windows version of "Curl" 
which is a commonly used linux command. By using this command, one can send HTTP messages. It 
supports POST and GET as well as a variety of encoding schemes. In our setup we used POST to send data.
The data itself is encoded in JSON.

The ClI features two commands. In the first command, a new machine is added. The parameter of this 
command is the name of the server to be created:

PLEASE PUT THE SYNTAX OF THE COMMAND IN HERE よろしく

No answer is received.

The second command enquires about all servers:

PLEASE PUT THE SYNTAX OF THE COMMAND IN HERE よろしく

The answer consists of a all servers which are currently running and it is encoded in JSON. 
It is send to a PHP file on the client. This file reads the JSON data, converts it and
enters it into a mysql database. The data of this mysql database can be read with a second PHP-script
which is accessible from the web.
